           The effectiveness of the Tax-Loss Harvesting strategy to reduce the
           tax liability of the client will depend on the client’s entire tax and
           investment profile, including purchases and dispositions in a client’s
           (or client’s spouse’s) accounts outside of Wealthfront Advisers and
           type of investments (e.g., taxable or nontaxable) or holding period
           (e.g., short- term or long-term).Tax loss harvesting may generate a
           higher number of trades due to attempts to capture losses. There is a
           chance that trading attributed to tax loss harvesting may create
           capital gains and wash sales and could be subject to higher
           transaction costs and market impacts. In addition, tax loss harvesting
           strategies may produce losses, which may not be offset by sufficient
           gains in the account and may be limited to a $3,000 deduction against
           income. The utilization of losses harvested through the strategy will
           depend upon the recognition of capital gains in the same or a future
           tax period, and in addition may be subject to limitations under
           applicable tax laws, e.g., if there are insufficient realized gains in
           the tax period, the use of harvested losses may be limited to a $3,000
           deduction against income and distributions. Losses harvested through
           the strategy that are not utilized in the tax period when recognized
           (e.g., because of insufficient capital gains and/or significant
           capital loss carryforwards), generally may be carried forward to
           offset future capital gains, if any.
